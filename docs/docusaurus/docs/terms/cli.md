## Overview

### Definition

CLI stands for Command Line Interface.

### Current Status

The CLI is being retired. With improvements and simplifications to the Great Expectations API, we can now perform most operations with concise Python code and minimal setup. For help with the CLI, please see an [earlier version of our docs](/docs/0.15.50/terms/cli).
